# Smart-Farm
Our motivation was to build an intelligent irrigation system for a farm field.The irrigation system consists of servo motors that control the water supply to the farm, based on the present humidity, temperature levels in the farm. Using sensor data, Our system contains a machine learning model that predicts how much water (in percentage) should be supplied to the farm. We made system in such a way that Farmer does not want to water the plants during nighttime.

We have used  IoT simulator at this link (https://wokwi.com/arduino/new?template=arduino-mega) and designed a farm irrigation circuit using Arduino Mega board. Identify the required sensors needed to build the irrigation system based on our requirements from the list of sensors provided by the simulator. Our irrigation system is able to 
feed the sensor readings to a machine learning model and produce the correct signal (% of water flow) to control the water supply. Using a servo motor to control the water supply. Our farm irrigation system has four sensor units such that each unit sense temperature and humidity values. These values are provided to ML model on the Arduino board to predict the water flow in percentage. Then the water flow percentage will be provided as input to the servo motor (Mapping is done the percentage values with servo motor rotation 0◦ to 180◦). The sensor values from each sensor unit is able to control a servo motor. Also, display the % of water flow that is fed as input to servo motors on an LCD.
